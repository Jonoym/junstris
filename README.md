Tetris coded in Java.

The project started in July of 2021 during my semester break to further develop my understanding of Java, JavaFX and intefaces. The game was coded in Java after my university Java course which delved into the importance of cohesion and coupling and the use of model-view-controller separation. 

I have previously coded tetris before in python but this project focuses on the interfaces, player experience and other features a game would include. These features include:
- an updated controller system using a DAS(delayed auto shift) to create a more fluid system
- multiple pages such as settings, about and different game modes
- main title page which includes animations on hover
- changeable settings for controls
- audio on piece placement
